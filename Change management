Configuration management 
and change management are two closely related but different terms. 
Configuration management deals with the state of any given infrastructure or 
software system at any given time. Change management, in contrast, deals with how changes 
are made to those configurations. Think of it this way: configuration management is the configuration at any 
given time, and change management is the process for proposing, reviewing, implementing, and potentially rolling 
back changes to those configurations.
